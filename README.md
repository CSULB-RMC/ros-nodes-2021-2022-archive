# LBL ROS Programming Archive
In this repository is tarballs of all the older repositories we have worked on over the years. They cover things like when we first started using ROS with ROS 1, to our experiments with Camera and obstacle detection in 2021-2022.

A full list of the archives is as follows:

- teleop-2020-2021
- roscode-summer-2021
- roscode-arduino
- roscode-camera
- roscode-autonomy
- roscode-teleop

The entire git repository is preserved in each tarball, so one could checkout the different branches and see the history of commits when extracted.
